# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview of the challenge

The crowdfunding company, Independent Funding, has just received a new dataset that contains information about the backers who’ve pledged to the live projects. And, Independent Funding wants me to perform both an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries.

In this Challenge, I used Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, I extracted and transformed the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that I exported as a CSV file.  I then did the load phase.  Specifically, I used the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the `crowdfunding_db` database.  And, I uploaded the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally, I performed a data analysis on the `crowdfunding_db` database by using SQL queries.
